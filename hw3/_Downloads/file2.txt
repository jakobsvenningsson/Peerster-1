urological training (coordination, accuracy, agility, and balance) available to an athlete, and parallettes training is
essential to your gymnastics development.
We hope our fervor for parallettes training specifically and gymnastics training generally will inspire all of you to
get hold of a pair of parallettes and begin your gymnastics training in earnest.
To that end we offer this month step-by-step instructions for building a great set of parallettes out of PVC pipe
available wherever building supplies or landscaping materials are sold.
Four things inspire this project: 1. They’re dirt-cheap ($10-2


With CrossFit PT every workout provides a useful data
point. We collect relative and absolute performance
measures every single workout. Measurement is
important and no PT program we know of offers as many
opportunities for metrics as CrossFit. The information
that can be mined from an individual’s, team’s, or
company’s performance is incredible, invaluable, and
generally not available with traditional PT.
Distillation of every workout to a single value turns
PT into sport. Relative and absolute measures readily
convert to “points”, and “men will die for points”.
Colonel Jeff Cooper observed in “Principles of Personal
Defense” that, “fear of sporting failure is usually greater
than the fear of death.” We routinely watch warriors
push themselves harder for a “win” or “placing” than
any coach would ever consider wise or prudent to push
the athlete. Our scoreboards (whiteboards) inspire
each round of competitors to ask, “What are we doing
today?” “Who did what?” and then internally, “What do
I have to do to take it?”
Our police academy graduates ask to come back for PT
after graduation and soldiers ask for PT on weekends.
CrossFit is fun, the kind of fun that can boost morale and
save lives - Army Captain Michael Perry offered among
the benefits of his men’s first 5 months of CrossFit that,
“first and most importantly lifelong friendships forged
from extreme physical and mental challenges. Rarely
does a day go by without laughter and agony which must
be the recipe for strong camaraderie.”
like punishment.
Our use of functional movements has also reduced
the chronic overuse injuries that plague traditional PT
program participants. Injuries to the back and knees,
shin splints, and other “sick day” maladies have been
greatly reduced with implementation of CrossFit.
Finally, the intensity of our workouts was designed
with the sole objective of maximizing adaptation. One
critical side benefit has been a dramatic reduction in PT
training time while greatly improving the payout.
Where tested, CrossFit PT has been shown to be
a dramatic improvement to traditional PT in these

Testing/metrics
Psychological demands
Battlefield/street engagement
For corroboration from military and law enforcement
professionals for ANY of these claims drop us a line at
info@crossfit.com and we’ll put you in touch with the
guys who really count.
One surprising result of the deliberate and public
performance ranking for each workout has been the
motivation and acceleration of improvement of those
less physically capable by temperament, training, or
natural limitation. Ranking has seemingly done more fordsfddd
